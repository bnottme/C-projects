1. Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

The project is a grocery item tracking application that reads and processes data from an input file. It allows users to search for the frequency of a specific item, print item frequencies, print item frequencies in a histogram format, save the data to a backup file, and exit the program. The goal is to help users keep track of the frequency of items they purchase in a grocery store.

2. What did you do particularly well?

The code is well-structured and follows good coding practices. It separates functionalities into methods, making it modular and readable. The program efficiently processes input data and builds a frequency map of grocery items.

3. Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

Error handling and validation for user inputs could be improved to handle unexpected input values or edge cases. A more detailed user interface with better prompts and user guidance could enhance user experience.

4. Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

The most challenging aspect of the project involved efficiently processing input files and managing the whitespace within each item, ensuring accurate data handling.

5. What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

Skills learned in this project, such as file input/output, working with data structures (in this case, a map), and implementing a user menu, can be applied to other projects that involve data processing and user interaction.
  
6. How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

The code's maintainability and readability are good due to clear method names and comments, with the documentation of the code.
