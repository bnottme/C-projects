1. Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

The project created was for a made up company called chada tech who wanted to implement a 12 and 24 hour clock into their website.

2. What did you do particularly well?

I created a clock that was presented well and created clean and concise codes and comments that made the program readable.

3. Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

I could enhance this project by making it able to synch in real time.

4. Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

The most tricky part of this project was converting the different time with 12 and 24 hours. I overcame this by looking at lots of different C++ tutorials to help me figure out the best solution.

5. What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

The transferable skills from this project are the creation of classes and private and public varibles.

6. How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I made the program maintinable by the creation of class and adding comments making it readable and adaptable to any future programmers.
