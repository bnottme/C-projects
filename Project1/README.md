1. Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

This project was undertaken for CHADA Tech, a fictitious company looking to implement a clock feature, both in 12-hour and 24-hour formats, on their website.

2. What did you do particularly well?

The code is well-structured with a clear division into functions and classes. The program successfully implements the clock feature, offering both 12-hour and 24-hour formats.

3. Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

Consider real-time synchronization of the clock, possibly by fetching the current time from a reliable source.

4. Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

The most challenging aspect of this project was likely converting between 12-hour and 24-hour time formats. I overcame this by studying C++ tutorials, which is a good approach to solve complex problems.

5. What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

Skills developed in this project include working with classes, private and public variables, user input handling, and time formatting.

6. How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I made the program maintinable by the creation of class and adding comments making it readable and adaptable to any future programmers.
