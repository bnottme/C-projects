Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The project created was for a made up company called chada tech who wanted to implement a 12 and 24 hour clock into their website.

What did you do particularly well?
I created a clock that was presented well and created clean and concise codes and comments that made the program readable.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?


Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?


What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?


How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
